PREFACE

THE way of the beginner in Latin is only too often
confined to those subjects where the faculties of the
mind, aside from memory, find little chance for devel-
opment. For a year pupils spend long hours in end-
less drill on the rules of grammar, on declensions and
conjugationS, and on the perplexities of syntax. It is
not strange, therefore, that numerous attempts have
been made to assist the beginner to an opportunity
now and then for refreshing his mind, and at the
sarne time for applying his new acquirements.

Those have succeeded best, Ι believe, who have
kept most closely to the things of antiquity‚ described
in the language of ancient Rome. Pupils recognize
the modern tone of present-day topics discussed in
English· -like Latin, and they are not satisfied‚ nor are
they much helped.

The Fables 1n this Reader are the old oneS, simpli-
fied for beginners. The Short StorieS, gathered here
and there, have also been freed from difficulties.
The Tales of Early Rome are from Livy and have
been adapted to pupils who have not yet gone far
along the course. And, finally, although the selec-
tion from Ovid has been turned into prose and shorn
· of its grammatical difficultieS‚ it is believed that the
charm of the story itself has not suffered.
